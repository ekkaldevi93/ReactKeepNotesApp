# ReactKeepNotesApp

Hello,

Welcome to my React application designed using Hooks. React Hooks are a recent addition to React library 
and they help you write stateful functional components. 

This application is a basic replica of Google's KeepNotes app available on web. The React app dynamically
updates the UI based on user's interaction. Users can type in their notes and see them render with click
of a button. Although the app does not support back end functionality to store your notes to server.
It's just my small attempt to learn new things about React functionality.

Thanks, 
Shrikant E
